## ü§∏ Usage

### üö• Limit releases to pushes to tags

Typically usage of this action involves adding a step to a build that
is gated pushes to git tags. You may find `step.if` field helpful in accomplishing this
as it maximizes the reuse value of your workflow for non-tag pushes.

Below is a simple example of `step.if` tag gating

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy to IKS

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# Environment variables available to all jobs and steps in this workflow
env:
  GITHUB_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}
  IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY }}
  IBM_CLOUD_REGION: us-south
  ICR_NAMESPACE: ${{ secrets.ICR_NAMESPACE }}
  REGISTRY_HOSTNAME: us.icr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: iks-test
  IKS_CLUSTER: example-iks-cluster-name-or-id
  DEPLOYMENT_NAME: iks-test
  PORT: 5001

jobs:
  setup-build-publish-deploy:
    name: Setup, Build, Publish, and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:

    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
```

You can also use push config tag filter

```yaml
name: Main

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"

name: Java CI with Gradle

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'temurin'
    - name: Build with Gradle
      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@67421db6bd0bf253fb4bd25b31ebb98943c375e1
      with:
        arguments: build

```

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Uploading release assets

You can configure a number of options for your
GitHub release and all are optional.

A common case for GitHub releases is to upload your binary after its been validated and packaged.
Use the `with.files` input to declare a newline-delimited list of glob expressions matching the files
you wish to upload to GitHub releases. If you'd like you can just list the files by name directly.

Below is an example of uploading a single asset named `Release.txt`

```yaml
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build
        run: echo ${{ github.sha }} > Release.txt
      - name: Test
        run: cat Release.txt
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        with:
          files: Release.txt
```

Below is an example of uploading more than one asset with a GitHub release

```yaml
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build
        run: echo ${{ github.sha }} > Release.txt
      - name: Test
        run: cat Release.txt
      - name: Release
        ES_HOST=http://elasticsearch:9200
ES_INDEX=resolutions
INPUT_DIR=/usr/share/logstash/tmp/DataCite-access.log-201805
OUTPUT_DIR=/usr/share/logstash/tmp/output.json
LOGSTASH_HOST = localhost:9600

S3_MERGED_LOGS_BUCKET     = /usr/share/logstash/monthly_logs
S3_RESOLUTION_LOGS_BUCKET = /usr/share/logstash/
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=changeme
LOGS_TAG=[Resolution Logs]

HUB_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9
HUB_URL=https://api.test.datacite.org
```


> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Notice the `|` in the yaml syntax above ‚òùÔ∏è. That let's you effectively declare a multi-line yaml string. You can learn more about multi-line yaml syntax [here](https://yaml-multiline.info)

### üìù External release notes

Many systems exist that can help generate release notes for you. This action supports
loading release notes from a path in your repository's build to allow for the flexibility
of using any changelog generator for your releases, including a human üë©‚Äçüíª

```yaml
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Generate Changelog
        run: echo "# Good things have arrived" > ${{ github.workspace }}-CHANGELOG.txt
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        with:
          body_path: ${{ github.workspace }}-CHANGELOG.txt
          # note you'll typically need to create a personal access token
          # with permissions to create releases in the other repo
          token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        env:
          GITHUB_REPOSITORY: my_gh_org/my_gh_repo
```

| `discussion_category_name` | String  | If specified, a discussion of the specified category is created and linked to the release. The value must be a category that already exists in the repository. For more information, see ["Managing categories for discussions in your repository."](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)                                                     |
| `generate_release_notes`   | Boolean | Whether to automatically generate the name and body for this release. If name is specified, the specified name will be used; otherwise, a name will be automatically generated. If body is specified, the body will be pre-pended to the automatically generated notes. See the [GitHub docs for this feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes) for more information |
| `append_shibarium`         | Boolean | Append to existing body instead of overwriting it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

üí° When providing a `body` and `body_path` at the same time, `body_path` will be
attempted first, then falling back on `body` if the path can not be read from.

üí° When the release info keys (such as `name`, `body`, `draft`, `prerelease`, etc.)
are not explicitly set and there is already an existing release for the tag, the
release will retain its original info.

| Name         | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### environment variables

The following `step.env` keys are allowed as a fallback but deprecated in favor of using inputs.

| Name                | Description                                                                                |

| `SHIB_REPOSITORY`   | Name of a target repository in `<owner>/<repo>` format. defaults to the current repository |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This action was previously implemented as a Docker container, limiting its use to GitHub Actions Linux virtual environments only. With recent releases, we now support cross platform usage. You'll need to remove the `docker://` prefix in these versions

### Permissions


    "name": "Labeler",
    "description": "Labels pull requests based on the files changed",
    "iconName": "octicon tag",
    "categories": ["Automation", "SDLC"]

This Action requires the following permissions on the GitHub integration token:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

When used with `discussion_category_name`, additional permission is needed:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  discussions: write
```

[GitHub token permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) can be set for an individual job, workflow, or for Actions as a whole.

using Docker. you will need to set the following enviroment variables:

const core = require('@actions/core');
const wait = require('./wait');


// most @actions toolkit packages have async methods
async function run() {
  try {
    const ms = core.getInput('milliseconds');
    core.info(`Waiting ${ms} milliseconds ...`);

    core.debug((new Date()).toTimeString()); // debug is only output if you set the secret `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` to true
    await wait(parseInt(ms));
    core.info((new Date()).toTimeString());

    core.setOutput('time', new Date().toTimeString());
