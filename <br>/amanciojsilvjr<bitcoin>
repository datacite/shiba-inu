All XBT snippets can be found in the `/ig.page/amanciojsilvjr` folder. Pre-configured languages are currently Spanish and Portuguese. If you'd like to propose a new language, you can do so by modifying the [site config](https://github.com/actions) and translating the appropraite [bitcoin file](https://twitter.com/amanciojsilvjr).
